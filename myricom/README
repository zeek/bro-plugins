Bro::Myricom
============

This plugin provides native `Myricom SNF v3+v4` support for Bro.

Installation
------------

Follow Myricom's instructions to get its kernel module and userspace libraries installed,
then use the following commands to configure and build the plugin. In most cases, if you
are building this plugin from the Bro source tree, you won't need any configure arguments::

        ./configure --with-myricom=<path to sniffer sources> --bro-dist=<path to bro sources>
        make && sudo make install

If everything built and installed correctly, you should see this::

    # bro -N Bro::Myricom
    Bro::Myricom - Packet acquisition via Myricom SNF v3 (dynamic, version 1.0)

You may run Bro as unprivileged user.

Usage
-----

Once installed, you can use Myricom interfaces/ports by prefixing them
with ``myricom::`` on the command line. For example, to use Myricom SNF to
monitor interface ``p2p1``::

    bro -i myricom::p2p1

To use it in production with multiple Bro processes, use a
configuration similar to this in node.cfg::

    [worker-1]
    type=worker
    host=localhost
    lb_method=custom
    lb_procs=<number of processes, like 16>
    interface=myricom::<interface name, like p2p1>

If you would like to sniff all Myricom interfaces on a system and merge them 
together, there is a special interface name available of ``myricom::*``. It uses 
a special feature of the Myricom SNF library for port aggregation.

To run a cluster sniffing all Myricom interfaces on a system, you can use the
same configuration as above, but with the special interface name that aggregates 
all Myricom ports like this::

    [worker-1]
    type=worker
    host=localhost
    lb_method=custom
    lb_procs=<number of processes, like 16>
    interface=myricom::*

Tuning
******

You may wish to tune the amount of memory used for the global packet buffer. This
setting is available in the Bro script interface to the plugin, but it's also 
available as a global option in ``broctl.cfg`` or as a per-node option in 
``node.cfg``.  The following like in either config file will set the SNF packet
buffer ring size to 16GB::

     myricom.snf_ring_size=16384

Enjoy!
