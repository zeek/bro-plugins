Extended TCP Analysis
=====================

TCPRS is a TCP traffic analyzer that specializes in the detection
and classification of retransmission and network reordering events.

The following forms of events are available in the TCPRS analyzer:

    - Dead connection detection
    - TCP option detection
    - Retransmission detection and classification
    - Limited Transmit and Fast Recovery detection
    - Network reordering detection and classification
    - RTT and initial RTO measurements

To activate all of the new functionality, load ``Bro/TCPRS``. To use
the analyzer without the use of any of the provided scripts, you can
enable it inside a ``bro_init`` handler::

    event bro_init()
	    {
        TCPRS::EnableTCPRSAnalyzer();
        }

Included with the analyzer is a collection of 103 test cases that
are used for iterative design and refinement of the analyzer. Each
test case is used to verify a specific function of the analyzer or
general classification of events.
