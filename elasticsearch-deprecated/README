=========================================
Indexed Logging Output with ElasticSearch
=========================================

Intro
-----

Bro's default ASCII log format is not exactly the most efficient way
for searching large volumes of data. ElasticSearch is a new data
storage technology for dealing with tons of data. It's also a search
engine built on top of Apache's Lucene project. It scales very well,
both for distributed indexing and distributed searching.

Warning
-------

This writer plugin only supports ElasticSearch 1; it will not work with
ElasticSearch version 2 and above. This writer plugin is deprecated and
will be removed from the Bro distribution in the future. This plugin is
experimental and not recommended for production use; it is for example
missing error handling and may loose messages.

Installing ElasticSearch
------------------------

Download the latest version from: http://www.elasticsearch.org/download/.
Once extracted, start ElasticSearch with::

# ./bin/elasticsearch

For more detailed information, refer to the ElasticSearch installation
documentation: http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/setup.html

Installing the ElasticSearch Plugin
-----------------------------------

First, ensure that you have libcurl (headers and library) installed. Then the
following will compile and install the plugin alongside Bro::

    # ./configure && make && make install

See the output of ``./configure --help`` for additional options if it
can't find any of the prerequisites.

If everything built and installed correctly, you should see this::

    # bro -N Bro::ElasticSearch
    Bro::ElasticSearch - ElasticSearch log writer (dynamic, version 1.0)

Activating ElasticSearch
------------------------

The easiest way to enable ElasticSearch output is to load the
plugin's ``logs-to-elasticsearch.bro`` script.  If you are using BroControl,
the following line in local.bro will enable it:

.. console::

    @load Bro/ElasticSearch/logs-to-elasticsearch.bro

With that, Bro will now write most of its logs into ElasticSearch in addition
to maintaining the Ascii logs like it would do by default.  That script has
some tunable options for choosing which logs to send to ElasticSearch, refer
to the autogenerated script documentation for those options.

There is an interface being written specifically to integrate with the data
that Bro outputs into ElasticSearch named Brownian.  It can be found here::

Tuning
------

A common problem encountered with ElasticSearch is too many files being held
open.  The ElasticSearch documentation has some suggestions on this and other
issues.

TODO
----

Lots.

- Perform multicast discovery for server.
- Better error detection.
- Better defaults (don't index loaded-plugins, for instance).
